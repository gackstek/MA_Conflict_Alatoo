ABSTRACT

Livestock depredation by wild animals is the main cause of conflict between humans and wild-life, posing a threat to the peaceful coexistence of people and animals worldwide by triggering retaliatory killings and economical losses for humans. In Kyrgyzstan, a country heavily reliant on pastoralism, these conflicts are particularly pronounced due to the presence of key predators such as snow leopards (Panthera uncia) and wolves (Canis lupus). Climate change exacerbates these conflicts by altering ecosystems, reducing prey availability, and forcing livestock to graze in areas with higher predation risks. Evaluating conflict occurrence over a range-wide habitat use requires information on conflict occurrence over broad geographic regions. I employed key-informant interviews and participatory mapping with 85 herders in the Alatoo landscape and gathered data on livestock depredation events during the summer of 2023. Using single-species occupancy models I analyzed the distribution of conflicts while accounting for imperfect detec-tion across interviewees. These approaches allowed to identify the spatial patterns of depreda-tion by large carnivores and explore herders' perceptions of how climate change impacts their livelihoods and conflict intensity. Across 25 kmÂ² cells, I recorded 354 instances of livestock presence and 266 conflict occurrences (site use). In the Alatoo region, high probability of site use was observed for livestock in 98 % of cells and for conflict in 96 % of cells. The results of the qualitative content analysis of the interviews revealed that herding communities in the Alatoo are experiencing increased vulnerability in livestock management due to extreme climate varia-bility. With migration to higher altitudes as the key adaptation strategy, competition with wild prey and increased conflict with predators are likely to increase in the future. The findings can provide critical insights into the evolving dynamics of human-wildlife coexistence in the region, and inform conservation strategies that balance the needs of pastoral communities and endan-gered wildlife under changing environmental conditions.
