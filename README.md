ABSTRACT

Crop and livestock depredation by wild animals is the main cause of conflict between humans and wildlife, posing a threat to the peaceful coexistence of people and animals worldwide by triggering retaliatory killings and economical losses for humans. In Kyrgyzstan, a country heavily reliant on pastoralism, these conflicts are particularly pronounced due to the presence of key predators such as snow leopards (Panthera uncia) and wolves (Canis lupus). Climate change exacerbates these conflicts by altering ecosystems, reducing prey availability, and forc-ing livestock to graze in areas with higher predation risks. Evaluating conflict occurrence over a range-wide habitat use requires information on conflict occurrence over broad geographic re-gions. I employed key-informant interviews and participatory mapping with 85 herders in the Alatoo landscape and gathered data on livestock depredation events during the summer of 2023, using occupancy modelling to analyze the distribution of conflicts while accounting for imper-fect detection across interviewees. This approach allowed to identify the spatial patterns of dep-redation by large carnivores and explore herders' perceptions of how climate change impacts their livelihoods and conflict intensity. Records were acquired within XX cells. Mean occupan-cy in the study area was highest for … and lowest for … The results of the qualitative content analysis of the interviews revealed that herding communities in the Alatoo are experiencing in-creased vulnerability in livestock management due to extreme climate variability. With migration to higher altitudes as the key adaptation strategy, competition with wild prey and increased con-flict with predators are likely to increase in the future. The findings can provide critical insights into the evolving dynamics of human-wildlife coexistence in the region, and inform conserva-tion strategies that balance the needs of pastoral communities and endangered wildlife under changing environmental conditions.
